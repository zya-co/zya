          #### What does this Privacy Policy cover?

          Zya Enzymes Ltd (“Zya Enzymes”, “we”, “us” or “our”) understands that your privacy is important to you and that you care about how your Personal Data is used. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your Personal Data.  

          This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data when making available our websites that link to this Privacy Policy (together, the “Site”), as well as associated marketing activities and other activities described in this Privacy Policy. Under the GDPR, we are a ‘controller’ for the activities covered by this Privacy Policy.

          For reference, when we refer to “Personal Data”, we mean any information which identifies you as an individual or which otherwise renders you identifiable. When we use the term “GDPR”, we are referring to both the so-called UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) and/or the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”) (as and where applicable in the circumstances).

          We use Charlie Recruit, an online application provider and applicant tracking system (ATS) for assisting with our recruitment processes. Charlie Recruit process personal information as an independent data Controller; you can find their Privacy Policy by visiting https\://www\.charliehr.com/privacy  

          Where you apply for a job opening posted by Us, these Privacy Notice provisions will apply to Our processing of your personal information in addition to Our other Privacy Notice which has been provided to you separately or is available on Our Website.

          #### What Personal Data we collect

          The Personal Data we typically collect about you is outlined below:

          Contact Data - Your full name and email address, and telephone numbers. The organisation you work for or represent (should you provide it to us). 

          Communications Data - Information you exchange with us in your communications with us, plus your preferences relating to our emails. This includes any Personal Data you provide in any free-text ‘message’ fields via which you can communicate with us on the Site (e.g., using the ‘Contact Us’ functionality).

          Personal Data - includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title or position, date of birth, and gender.

          Eligibility Data -  includes right to work information, citizenship, and criminal background checks.

          Technical Data - includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access our platform.

          Profile Data - includes your username and password, your interests, preferences, feedback, and survey responses.

          Usage Data - includes information about how you use our platform.

          Marketing and Communications Data - includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.

          Our platform provider Charlie Recruit will also collect, use, store, and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data.  Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data is anonymised/ pseudononymised and will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.  For example, we may aggregate your Professional Data to develop analytics with respect to a specific platform feature or component.  However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

          No obligation to provide Personal Data. You do not have to provide Personal Data to us. However, where we need to process your Personal Data either to comply with applicable law or to deliver our Site, and you fail to provide that Personal Data when requested, we may not be able to provide some or all parts of our Site. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.

          Don’t give us sensitive information. We ask that you do not provide us with any sensitive types of Personal Data (e.g., health-related information, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, criminal convictions information etc) – whether through the Site or otherwise. For example, please do not input any of these types of sensitive information in any free-text ‘message’ fields via which you can communicate with us on the Site (e.g., using the ‘Contact Us’ functionality).

          #### How Your Personal Data is Collected

          We may use different methods to collect data from and about you, including:

          Direct Interactions. You may give us your Identity and Contact Data by filling in forms and fields on our application form, and you may give us your Professional and Eligibility Data in the form of a resume or covering letter.  This includes personal data you provide when you apply for a role and provide us with feedback or contact us. 

          Third parties or Publicly Available Sources. We may receive personal data about you from various third parties and public sources as set out below:

          Professional Data from professional profiles available in the public domain (for example, LinkedIn, Twitter, or corporate website); and

          Identity and Contact Data from publicly available sources.

          #### How we use your Personal Data and why

          * Access. Provide you with information about our processing of your Personal Data and give you access to your Personal Data.
          * Correct. Update or correct inaccuracies in your Personal Data.
          * Delete. Delete your Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it - you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
          * Transfer. Transfer to you or a third party of your choice a machine-readable copy of your Personal Data which you have provided to us.

          * Withdraw Consent. When we use your Personal Data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.  

          Exercising your rights

          To exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us using the contact details shown below. 

          We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Whether or not we are required to fulfil any request you make will depend on a number of factors (e.g., why and how we are processing your Personal Data), if we reject any request you may make (whether in whole or in part) we will let you know our grounds for doing so at the time, subject to any legal restrictions. Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights; however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. 

          Timing

          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within a month of receipt. It may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests; in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 

          #### How we share your Personal Data

          We may share your Personal Data with the following categories of recipient and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, in other applicable notices, or at the time of collection.  

          Affiliates. Our subsidiaries and affiliates (from time to time).

          Service providers. Third parties that provide services on our behalf or help us operate parts of the Site or our business (such as our hosting providers, information technology/security providers, customer support, email delivery, marketing, consumer research and website analytics). 

          Professional advisors. Professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

          Authorities and others. Law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties, as we believe in good faith to be necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.

          Parties to corporate events. We may disclose Personal Data in the context of actual or prospective corporate events (e.g., investments in Zya Enzymes, financing of Zya Enzymes, or the sale, transfer or merger of all or part of our business, assets or shares), for example, we may need to share certain Personal Data with prospective counterparties and their advisers. We may also disclose your Personal Data to an acquirer, successor, or assignee of Zya Enzymes as part of any acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, and/or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal Data is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.

          #### Transfers outside Europe

          We may share your Personal Data with third parties who are based outside the UK and European Economic Area (“Europe”), including the United States. 

          Where we share your Personal Data with third parties who are based outside Europe, we try to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by making sure one of the following mechanisms is implemented: 

          Transfers to territories with an adequacy decision. We may transfer your Personal Data to countries or territories whose laws have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) (from time to time) or under specific adequacy frameworks approved by the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) (from time to time), such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework or the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.

          #### Transfers to territories without an adequacy decision. 

          We may transfer your Personal Data to countries or territories whose laws have not been deemed to provide such an adequate level of protection (e.g., the United States).  

          However, in these cases:

          we may use specific appropriate safeguards, which are designed to give Personal Data effectively the same protection it has in Europe – for example, standard-form contracts approved by relevant authorities for this purpose; or 

          in limited circumstances, we may rely on an exception, or ‘derogation’, which permits us to transfer your Personal Data to such country despite the absence of an ‘adequacy decision’ or ‘appropriate safeguards’ – for example, reliance on your explicit consent to that transfer. 

          You may contact us using the details below if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data outside of Europe.

          #### Security

          We employ technical, organisational and physical safeguards designed to protect your Personal Data (including to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed).  For example, we limit access to your Personal Data to only those employees and other staff who have a business need to have such access. All such people are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

          In addition, we have put in place procedures to deal with potential personal data breaches affecting your Personal Data. In the event of any such breach, we have systems in place to notify and work with applicable regulators where required. In addition, in certain circumstances (e.g., where we are legally required to do so) we may notify you of more serious personal data breaches affecting your Personal Data.

          Please note that despite the efforts described above, as our Site is hosted electronically, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.

          #### Retention

          We are committed to only keeping your Personal Data for so long as we reasonably need to use it for the purposes set out above. This general rule applies unless a longer retention period is required by law.

          To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. 

          When we no longer require the Personal Data that we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

          #### Third party links

          This Site may include links to third party websites, platforms, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share your Personal Data.

          If you would like to make a complaint regarding this Privacy Policy or our practices in relation to your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details shown below. We will reply to your complaint as soon as we can.
