          #### What does this Privacy Policy cover?

          Zya Enzymes Ltd (“Zya Enzymes”, “we”, “us” or “our”) understands that your privacy is important to you and that you care about how your Personal Data is used. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your Personal Data.  

          This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data when making available our websites that link to this Privacy Policy (together, the “Site”), as well as associated marketing activities and other activities described in this Privacy Policy. Under the GDPR, we are a ‘controller’ for the activities covered by this Privacy Policy.

          For reference, when we refer to “Personal Data”, we mean any information which identifies you as an individual or which otherwise renders you identifiable. When we use the term “GDPR”, we are referring to both the so-called UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) and/or the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”) (as and where applicable in the circumstances).

          We use Charlie Recruit, an online application provider and applicant tracking system (ATS) for assisting with our recruitment processes.

For example, please do not input any of these types of sensitive information in any free-text ‘message’ fields via which you can communicate with us on the Site (e.g., using the ‘Contact Us’ functionality).
