        richtext: "#### Sugar reduction has been a major focus in the food industry for years, but most solutions come with trade-offs—whether it's artificial sweeteners that alter taste, natural sugar substitutes that have poor health perception, or reformulated products that compromise texture and satisfaction.\n\nAt Zya, we believe in a different approach. Instead of removing sugar, what if we could change the way our bodies digest sugar? That’s exactly what our enzyme ingredient, [Convero](/convero) does.\n\nConvero is a cutting-edge enzyme designed to work after consumption, converting up to 30% of sucrose (table sugar) into inulin, a prebiotic fiber. This means food retains its original taste, texture, and formulation, while sugar's impact is naturally reduced inside the body.\n\nBut how does it actually work?\n\n## How Convero Works – The Science of Sugar-to-Fiber Conversion\n\nConvero is an inulosucrase [enzyme](/approach), meaning it specifically targets sucrose, the sugar found in everything from soft drinks to baked goods. Unlike traditional sugar substitutes that replace sucrose, Convero modifies sugar after digestion, ensuring that up to 30% of it is converted into fiber instead of being absorbed as glucose and fructose.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown of Convero’s Action\n\n1. Enzyme Activation in the Gut – When food is eaten, Convero remains inactive in the product itself but becomes active once it reaches the digestive system.\n2. Sucrose Breakdown & Fiber Formation – Convero binds to sucrose molecules, breaking them apart and recombining them into inulin, a type of prebiotic fiber.\n3. Reduced Sugar Absorption – Instead of 100% of sucrose being absorbed as sugar, 30% is redirected into fiber, bypassing sugar metabolism and instead feeding beneficial gut bacteria.\n\nNow that you know how Convero works, let’s take a look at why it can have such an important impact on nutrition and health by taking an in-depth look at the problem with sugar overconsumption, the importance of fiber in a balanced diet, and the role of prebiotics in promoting a healthy gut.\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/blog_images/10.webp\" widthMobile={8} widthDesktop={10} aspectRatio={1.5} />\n\n## The Problem With Too Much Sugar\_\n\nSugar has long been a staple of modern diets, enhancing flavor and texture in everything from breakfast cereals to beverages. However, the overconsumption of sugar has reached alarming levels, contributing to widespread public health challenges. In the U.S., the average person today consumes [over 17 teaspoons of added sugar daily](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much#:~\\:text=Adults%20and%20young%20adults%20in,%2C10%2Dpound%20bowling%20balls.) — more than double the recommended limit.\_\n\nThis excessive intake is linked to a host of metabolic and lifestyle-related health concerns. While sugar itself is not inherently harmful, consuming it in excess and in processed forms (such as High-Fructose Corn Syrup) has created a global nutrition crisis.\n\n### Sugar’s Role in Metabolic Health\n\nWhen consumed in moderate amounts, sugar serves as a quick source of energy. However, excess sugar intake can disrupt metabolic balance, leading to:\n\n* Blood sugar spikes and crashes – When we eat high-sugar foods, our blood glucose levels spike rapidly, triggering an overproduction of insulin. This can lead to energy crashes, increased hunger, and cravings for even more sugar.\n* Increased fat storage – When excess sugar isn't used for immediate energy, it gets stored as fat, contributing to weight gain and metabolic imbalances.\n* Higher risk of insulin resistance – Over time, frequent sugar spikes can lead to insulin resistance, where the body's cells no longer respond properly to insulin. This is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders.\n\n### Sugar and Its Impact on Heart Health\n\nBeyond metabolic concerns, high sugar consumption is strongly linked to cardiovascular issues. A study published in [JAMA Internal Medicine](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1819573) found that individuals who consumed more than 25% of their daily calories from added sugar were twice as likely to die from heart disease as those who consumed less than 10%.\n\nExcess sugar contributes to heart disease by:\n\n* Increasing triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood linked to heart disease)\n* Lowering \"good\" HDL cholesterol\n* Raising inflammation markers, which can damage blood vessels over time\n\n### The Connection Between Sugar, Mood, and Mental Health\n\nSugar consumption doesn't just affect the body — it impacts the brain, too. Research has shown that diets high in added sugars are associated with increased rates of anxiety and depression. A study in Scientific Reports found that high sugar intake was linked to a 23% higher risk of common mental health disorders among men \\[[source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05649-7)].\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\n* Sugar consumption triggers dopamine release, creating a temporary \"feel-good\" effect—but when blood sugar crashes, so does mood stability.\n* Chronic sugar intake can lead to neuroinflammation, which is increasingly being linked to mental health issues.\n* Poor gut health (which is influenced by sugar intake) is now believed to play a role in brain function and emotional regulation.\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/blog_images/11.webp\" />\n\n### The Hidden Problem – Sugar is Everywhere\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of reducing sugar intake is that it hides in unexpected places. While most people associate sugar with desserts or sodas, the reality is that added sugars are found in over [74% of packaged foods](https://www.bswhealth.com/blog/sugar-sweet-truth).\n\nSome of the worst offenders include:\n\n* Flavored yogurts – A single serving can contain as much sugar as a candy bar.\n* Granola bars and cereals – Marketed as \"healthy,\" but often loaded with hidden sweeteners.\n* Sauces and condiments – Ketchup, BBQ sauce, and salad dressings can contain multiple teaspoons of added sugar per serving.\n* Plant-based milks – Many non-dairy alternatives contain added sugars to improve taste.\n* Gluten free alternatives - often contain more sugars and fats than the foods they are replacing.\_\n\nEven people who actively try to reduce sugar often consume more than they realize because of these hidden sources.\n\n### Why Traditional Sugar Reduction Efforts Aren’t Working\n\nWith growing awareness of sugar’s impact on health, food brands have attempted to reduce sugar in products — but the results have been mixed.\n\nReformulation strategies with sugar alternatives fall short in different ways:\n\n1. Artificial Sweeteners (Aspartame, Sucralose, Saccharin) – While calorie-free, these additives often leave an unpleasant aftertaste, and consumer trust in them is declining due to safety concerns (although most of these might be unfounded).\n2. Sugar Alcohols (Erythritol, Sorbitol, Xylitol) – Found in “sugar-free” products, these sweeteners can cause digestive discomfort when consumed in excess.\n3. Rare Sugars (Allulose, Tagatose) - expensive and hard to scale, meaning that products come with an out-of-reach premium to consumers. Rare sugars can also cause some stomach discomfort if over consumed.\_\_\n4. Sweet proteins (Brazzein, Thaumatin) - hundreds of times sweeter than sugar, requiring major reformulation with other ingredients in a blend to add bulk back to food; resulting in products that taste noticeably different, leading to consumer rejection.\n\nOther approaches by the industry include:\_\n\n1. Shrinking the portion size of brands to reduce sugar intake which leaves consumers feeling short changed and frustrated by having to pay more for less (“shrinkflation”)\n2. Lowing sugar content slowly over time to adjust consumer preference (“health through stealth”), but there’s a risk that consumers will switch to competitors offering sweeter products to match their taste preferences.\_\_\_\n\n### A Smarter, Science-Driven Solution\n\nConsumers want less sugar, but they also want the same great taste. This is where Convero offers a completely new approach—one that reduces sugar’s impact without altering the food experience itself. Helping to bring sugar consumption back into moderation.\_\n\nInstead of replacing sugar, Convero converts part of it into fiber during digestion, making sugar reduction effortless, scalable, and consumer-friendly.\n\n[Read how Convero works.](/convero)\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/blog_images/12.webp\" widthDesktop={10} widthMobile={8} />\n\n## The Benefits of Fiber – A Rising Trend in Nutrition\n\nWhile sugar reduction is a priority, there’s another crucial piece of the puzzle that is often forgotten about: fiber. Most people aren’t just consuming too much sugar—they’re also not eating enough fiber.\n\n### The Fiber Deficit – A Growing Health Concern\n\nThe recommended daily fiber intake is 25-38g per day, yet the average person only consumes about 10-15g daily ([Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/should-i-be-eating-more-fiber-2019022115927)). This gap has major health implications, as fiber plays a crucial role in:\n\n* Supporting digestion – Helps food move through the gut, preventing constipation.\n* Regulating blood sugar – Slows glucose absorption, preventing sugar spikes.\n* Promoting satiety – Helps people feel fuller for longer, reducing overeating.\n\nThis widespread fiber deficiency isn’t just a minor nutritional gap—it’s a missed opportunity for better health. Without enough fiber, digestion slows, blood sugar fluctuates more dramatically, and feelings of fullness don’t last as long, making it harder to maintain a balanced diet. Over time, low fiber intake can contribute to metabolic imbalances, poor gut health, and an increased risk of chronic conditions. As awareness of fiber’s role in overall wellness grows, more consumers are looking for convenient, effective ways to increase their fiber intake — without compromising taste or lifestyle.\n\n### A Market Shift – Consumers Are Actively Seeking More Fiber\n\nThe global [dietary fibers market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/dietary-fibers-market) is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing consumer awareness of health and wellness. In 2023, the market was valued at approximately $7.95 billion and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5% from 2024 to 2030. However, many high-fiber products alter taste or texture, making them less appealing to mainstream consumers.\n\nConvero’s unique approach helps to solve this problem — it increases fiber intake after consumption without changing the eating experience.\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/blog_images/13.webp\" />\n\n## Prebiotics, the Microbiome, and Why It All Matters\n\nBeyond sugar reduction and fiber intake, gut health is a rising area of scientific and consumer interest. The human microbiome — composed of trillions of bacteria in the gut — has been shown to influence everything from digestion to immune function and even mental health ([Nature Reviews Microbiology, 2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-024-01068-4).\n\n### What Is a Prebiotic?\n\nA prebiotic is a type of fiber that serves as food for beneficial gut bacteria. Unlike probiotics (which are live bacteria), prebiotics help nourish the existing microbiome, promoting a healthier gut environment.\n\nInulin — the fiber produced by [Convero](/convero) — is one of the best-researched prebiotics, which are known for their ability to:\n\n* Promote the growth of beneficial bacteria – Supports populations of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, which are essential for gut balance and digestion.\n* Encourage the production of beneficial metabolites – Helps generate short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which fuel gut cells and support metabolic health.\n* Enhance nutrient absorption – Improves digestion efficiency, leading to better absorption of calcium, magnesium, and other essential nutrients.\n* Reduce protein fermentation in the gut – Minimizes the buildup of harmful byproducts that can contribute to bloating and discomfort.\n* Lower populations of harmful bacteria – Helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome by discouraging the growth of pathogenic microbes.\n* Support immune function – Strengthens gut-associated immune responses, enhancing the body's ability to fight infections and inflammation.\n* Protect the gut barrier – Helps reinforce intestinal permeability, preventing toxins and unwanted substances from entering the bloodstream.\n\nLearn more about the [Health Effects and Sources of Prebiotic Dietary Fiber](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6041804/#:~\\:text=Prebiotic%20dietary%20fibers%20act%20as,are%20universally%20agreed%2Dupon%20prebiotics.)\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/blog_images/14.webp\" />\n\n## A Smarter Way to Reduce Sugar Without Compromise\n\nConsumers are more health-conscious than ever, but they don’t want to trade taste for nutrition. The main problem with most sugar reduction efforts is that they replace sugar with substitutes which requires major reformulation.\n\nConvero takes a different approach — one that is:\n\n✔ Sustainable – No drastic or interventive dietary changes needed.\\\n✔ Scalable – Can be added to a variety of food products without altering recipes.\\\n✔ Consumer-friendly – No artificial ingredients, no aftertaste, just better nutrition.\n\nThis enzyme-powered technology is changing the way we think about sugar and fiber, proving that small changes at the molecular level can have big, lasting impacts on public health.\n\nWant to learn more about Convero?
